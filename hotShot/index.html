            <h2>What Is HotShot?</h2>
            <p>HotShot is the only online shooting competition platform. From the ease of any gun range, compete with other gun owners around the world in multi shooting categories.
            Hone your shooting skills with all pistols and all rifles at long and short range, and see how you match up with friends, family, and local or national shooterâ€™s.

            <h2>Why Do I need It?</h2>
            <p>Every gun owner and casual shooter has a competitive spirit but might not have the time or resources to attend shooting competitions which may or may not be in their area.
            Seeing a deficiency in the gun owner community, we decided to make competitive shooting available to all by creating our app, HotShot.

            <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
            <p>Our app HotShot uses your camera and photo identification software to analyze your target and calculate a specific score based off a few metrics. You simply take a picture of your target before your round of firing, then you take a clear picture of your target for calculation of your score.
            You can see how accurate you were at whatever range you shot at, and with our shot timer you can see how well you performed in a certain space of time.
