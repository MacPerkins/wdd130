            <h2>How We Started:</h2>
            <p>We started out like you did; simple gun owners looking to have a little competitive fun. As a family of outdoors loving people, we wanted to find a way to compete against family and friends while shooting but couldn’t find any options out there that were close to our location and were being done frequently.
            Once we realized that through the convenience of an app you could compete with other shooters around the world and not have to worry about a schedule, our idea for HotShot was born. Since then, our app and online community has grown and helped fulfill our dream of making competitive shooting available to every gun owner.
