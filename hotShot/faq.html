            <h2>What Type Of Target Do I Use?</h2>
            <p>There are two main ways to get targets for your shooting pleasure. Our app requires you to use our variety of targets for the time being as calculation of your score is depended on the predetermined scale and layout of our targets.
            Our website includes our free printable targets which you can use if you need some simple targets in a pinch. Through our website you can also order relatively inexpensive targets of varying size and styles.
            That way if you want a wider variety of targets for more long-range shots, you can have them!
