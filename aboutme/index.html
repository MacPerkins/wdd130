    <P>Hello everyone! To introduce myself, I am from Layton Utah in the USA.
    I am 22 years old and I am currently studying Applied Technology,
    planning to end up in a computer programming. I am currently single and 
    returned from my mission in 2021.</P>
    <p>I am currently working as a sunglasses outfitter inside of the 
    Farmington Cabelas, and I love it! I love the outdoors, hunting, fishing,
    and I am also into everything tech. Developing skills in web design will
    definitely help me with my future career as web development is part of
    what I'd like to be doing in the future.</p>
    <p>Thank you for getting to know me a bit by looking at my webpage.
    I look forward to participating with you in this class!</p>
